# codeforces-haskell
Practice problems from codeforces solved in haskell.

Tried to be as simple and clear as possible in the solutions, the problems are indexed in increasing order of difficulty along with the main topics used to solve them.

I solved some problems using different methods so they are listed more than once.

# Audience
People who have read or are reading [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) or [CIS 194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) (Recommended resources)

# Try it!
The problem statement is included in each source file and you can run the code (with GHC installed) yourself using:
```
runhaskell sourcefile.hs
```
